## Info
- Its recommended to first visit Dortania Opencore site befor
- We will use Opencore Simplify for EFI and USBTOOLBOX.KEXT and USBMAP.KEXT and add it manually and configure config.plist via OCAT
- Also view some EFI prepared by other referring to same / similar model
- Also view EFI from Olarila [but never use that directly cuz will not be supported by this installlation way] and check and compare the Quirks/Patches/Boot-ARGS and try to boot with them once
- After booting configure the things that you like.
